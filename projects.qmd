      (2) Algorithmic decision-making systems including reinforcement learning for policy optimization and resource allocation;  
      (3) Bayesian decision theory in high-stakes environments (e.g., healthcare, finance);  
      (4) Data-centric AI and algorithmic infrastructure;  
      (5) Algorithmic bias, fairness, and social impact modeling, along with responsible AI and secure deployment; and  
      (6) E-waste: allocative efficiency in the algorithmic economy.
